# *TO BOLDLY GO WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE*
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JL1701-D
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning as much useless general knowledge as possible.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python3, French and how to function with a broken hand.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him, but any/all work.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Giraffe have as many vertebrae as humans do. What's your excuse for the short neck?
